The idea of a sales funnel is something that new online business owners don't really to understand. Either they want to ignore funnels because they seem complicated, or think they don't need them. The sad thing is that if they actually implemented a good sales funnel, it would quickly and easily put them above their competition.

First off, before you read this, do not get overwhelmed. Sales funnels are extremely simple and can drastically improve the profitability of your business. When it comes to e-commerce, most people fail partly because they don't understand sales funnels. Every Shopify store technically has a sales funnel, it's just a really bad one. There are so many distractions for potential customers, and if they don't buy, you basically paid for that click and got absolutely nothing in return. A sales funnel allows you to capture their e-mail so you can stay in contact with them (for free), and increase your conversion rate by removing distractions. Also, it can increase your average order value, which will allow you to pay more per customer. This alone will help you out-market the competition and become more profitable.

The idea of a sales funnel is something that new online business owners don't really to understand. Either they want to ignore funnels because they seem complicated, or think they don't need them. The sad thing is that if they actually implemented a good sales funnel, it would quickly and easily put them above their competition.

First off, before you read this, do not get overwhelmed. Sales funnels are extremely simple and can drastically improve the profitability of your business. When it comes to e-commerce, most people fail partly because they don't understand sales funnels. Every Shopify store technically has a sales funnel, it's just a really bad one. There are so many distractions for potential customers, and if they don't buy, you basically paid for that click and got absolutely nothing in return. A sales funnel allows you to capture their e-mail so you can stay in contact with them (for free), and increase your conversion rate by removing distractions. Also, it can increase your average order value, which will allow you to pay more per customer. This alone will help you out-market the competition and become more profitable.

An Example of an E-Commerce Sales Funnel

Lets say a company wants to test an offer on a bracelet. The offer they choose is 50% off, which would drop the price from $50 to $25. When they run a Facebook ad to that product, the clicks go straight to a landing page on the funnel that they created. The landing page shows the product and its benefits, the 50% offer, and a clear call-to-action. When they click the call-to-action button, they need to enter their name and email. Once they submit, they are taken straight to an order page for that product, where they enter shipping and billing info. At the end of that page, they can complete their order. No distractions, instant gratification, straight to the point. After completing that order page, they are taken to an upsell page where they can add a matching necklace for 50% off as well. This is a one click upsell page where all they need to do is click a button, and they are automatically charged.

## What is ClickFunnels?

ClickFunnels is a software that allows you to easily create sales funnels. It does a lot more than that, but simply put it is the simplest funnel builder out there. It was created in 2014 by Russell Brunson, and has become a $100 Million a year business. His vision was to let people make funnels without investing thousands in coding, designing, etc. It has become the go-to tool for entrepreneurs and lets any beginner get a head start by setting up high-converting sales funnels in minutes.

## ClickFunnels Pricing

The base version of ClickFunnels is $97 a month. There is also a $297 tier which includes more advanced features without restrictions. Both offer split testing and email integration, as well as a free 14-day free trial.

With the base version ($97/month), you are limited to 20 funnels, 100 landing pages, and 20,000 visitors a month. For most beginners and business owners who aren't scaling with very high traffic, the base tier is enough.

When you're ready to start scaling, creating more funnels, and want to use the Etison Suite, then you should upgrade to the $297 a month version. At this point, the features you gain will outweigh the price, and it should be paying for itself easily.

## The problem with ClickFunnels

Lets start off with the problems that ClickFunnels has. There must be a reason that everyone doesn't have it right?

There are some issues, but none of them are close to a deal-breaker. 

First of all, at this point in time, there is no undo button. This will most likely change in the near future but right now you can't undo. When it comes to typing and simpler things like dragging content around, undo would be nice but isn't a huge deal. When it would be a real problem is when something is deleted. Some content can be customized heavily, and if its deleted you'll have to do it all over again. We expect this to change very soon, but right now that's actually one of the biggest problems, which actually says a lot.

There are some bugs here and there, like needing to refresh every now and then, and stats not loading the first time, but again there is nothing really that a refresh or re-login can't fix. If you do have some weird issue, customer support is really quick and will help you. 

As for why everyone doesn't use ClickFunnels, its either that they are in too deep with other software and don't feel like switching, are stubborn, or just don't understand the power of sales funnels in general. Almost every successful entrepreneur is aware of the power of ClickFunnels, and unless they have their own team to code custom funnels and high designers, they probably use and promote ClickFunnels. 

### Is ClickFunnels worth it?

Almost $100 per month price might seem high for some beginners, but is it really? The amount of tools that ClickFunnels replaces is insane, and not to mention plugins or apps to expand functionality. With the base plan, that is all you need to run your business. So for beginners, using just ClickFunnels is very good value and can allow you to have all the features you might not have even had before for less money. You can have a website, blog, e-commerce storefront, up-sells, automatic emails, opt-in pages, and webinars. I'm probably forgetting something else, but digging deeper in to the features, ClickFunnels is actually the only software beginners need. And if you still aren't sure, the 14-day free trial should be enough to convince you.

### Is ClickFunnels a scam?

The way some people try to advertise ClickFunnels can be kind of scammy. The reason for this, no one really knows. Most of them are probably just trying to make money off of you without giving real value. The fact is that ClickFunnels is in no way a scam, and that every business needs funnels. Whether you like ClickFunnels as a software is up to you, but the thousands of entrepreneurs who have tried it can vouch that it is the easiest way to build funnels, and that the community and support is huge. There's nothing better than having people around you that are successful, and are willing to help you.

## ClickFunnels Top Features List

### Drag and Drop Page Builder

ClickFunnels is all about ease of use. Building a funnel with Clickfunnels does not require any coding, development, or designing experience. Everything is drag and drop, and has a very small learning curve. This means an entrepreneur can stop wasting time and even if they don't have much experience, they can create an offer and sales funnel that converts very well, without all the time and effort required in the past. As mentioned before, funnels can be copied and shared, so all you need to do is add your copy, images, and customize colors and stuff to your own liking.

### Share Funnels

Not only can you choose from funnels that are provided by ClickFunnels, but people all over the internet have created funnels for all different kinds of businesses and offers. They are called Share Funnels. This means no matter what you want to do, there is a pre-built funnel for it. Just import and customize. It is always important to test different funnels and designs, but this feature overall can save you a lot of time.

### Simple A/B testing

With each funnel, you can create a simple A/B test, which allows you to test 2 versions of a funnel automatically. There is a slider where you can decide how the traffic gets split between the 2 and you will see the conversion results. To test properly, it is important to make subtle changes and make sure you're aware of the differences so you can clearly track and improve your funnels. You never know what can improve you conversions, so this easy testing is a killer feature, even if it is really simple.

## How to get started with ClickFunnels

If you've decided that you want to use sales funnels, you are ahead of the game. But you might be thinking, how will you actually make a funnel? How long will it take? How do I know it will work? These are all valid questions that you should be asking. There's a reason ClickFunnels has become so popular, and it is that you have the choice to build your own funnel, or use pre-built funnels. ClickFunnels has many funnels offered off the bat including e-commerce funnels, email opt-ins, webinar funnels, and many more. The great thing is that the structure of these funnels are proven, and all you have to do is customize them for your business and add copy. The best part, users can build funnels, and instantly share them with anyone else in the world. This means all over the internet are people sharing their funnels for free so you can copy them and try to imitate their success. The key is to find funnels that are proven and have high conversion rates. This means less work for you, and can help you reach your goals faster. As long as you have a vision and a product to offer, you should have no issue launching your first funnel.

## ClickFunnels Affiliate Program

One of the biggest bonuses for ClickFunnels is the affiliate program. If you don't know what affiliate marketing is, it's when you get paid to promote other people's products. If you refer someone else to ClickFunnels, you get paid 40% of monthly recurring revenue. It comes out to about $40 per user when they get the base version, and you get paid monthly for as long as they have ClickFunnels. 

If you love ClickFunnels and have an audience to recommend it to, or find a way to advertise it, you can make some serious money. This program is open to all users for free, and should definitely be taken advantage of. 

## Conclusion - Should you purchase ClickFunnels?

Simply put, if you are pursuing online business and have not implemented any real sales funnels yet, ClickFunnels is by far the best option. It is even possible to save money by switching to ClickFunnels, because you can eliminate other services that it replaces.

If you already have some funnels in place but are looking to switch, it is definitely an easy transition that is worth it. The simplicity, the community and support, and ability to copy/share funnels is all great. Not to mention you can easily build and manage a huge email list all in ClickFunnels.

Overall, the only downside to ClickFunnels is that it can be buggy sometimes, and maybe the price for some people that may not take advantage of all the features, but for 99% of people, ClickFunnels is by far the best tool for entrepreneurs and will make you a lot of money.

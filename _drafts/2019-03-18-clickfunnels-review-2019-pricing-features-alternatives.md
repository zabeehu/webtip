### What is a sales funnel?

First off, if you don't know what a sales funnel is, it is the process customers go through to purchase something. Properly guiding someone through the process can increase your conversion rate from the average 1%, to over 20% in some cases. Implementing a good sales funnel is key to being truly profitable. Some beginners think it is something fancy that they don't need, or don't want to take the time to understand.

## What is ClickFunnels?

ClickFunnels is a software that allows you to easily create sales funnels. It does a lot more than that, but simply put it is the simplest funnel builder out there. It was created in 2014 by Russell Brunson, and has become a $100 Million a year business. His vision was to let people make funnels without investing thousands in coding, designing, etc. It has become the go-to tool for entrepreneurs and can let any beginner get a head start by settting up proven sales funnels in minutes.

## ClickFunnels Pricing - Is it worth it?

The regular version of ClickFunnels is $97 a month. There is also a $297 tier which includes more advanced features when it comes to email automation, and allows you to create unlimited funnels. However, the $97 version is sufficient especially if you are just starting out.

The $97 per month price might seem high for some beginners, but is it really? The amount of tools that ClickFunnels replaces is insane, and not to mention plugins or apps to expand functionality. With the base plan, that is all you need to run your business. So for beginners, using just ClickFunnels is very good value and can allow you to have all the features you might not have even had before for less money. You can have a website, blog, e-commerce storefront, upsells, automatic emails, opt-in pages, and webinars. I'm probably forgetting something else, but digging deeper in to the features, ClickFunnels is actually the only software beginners need. And if you still aren't sure, the 14-day free trial should be enough to convince you.

## Is ClickFunnels a scam?

The way some people try to advertise ClickFunnels can be kind of scammy. The reason for this, no one really knows. Most of them are probably just trying to make money off of you without giving real value. The fact is that ClickFunnels is in no way a scam, and that every business needs funnels. Whether you like ClickFunnels as a software is up to you, but the thousands of entrepreneurs who have tried it can vouch that it is the easiest way to build funnels, and that the community and support is huge. There's nothing better than having people around you that are successful, and are willing to help you.

ClickFunnels vs Shopify

Before using ClickFunnels in our business, we were running a Shopify store. We wanted to implement a better funnel for free plus shipping. To do this, we used an app called Zipify OneClickUpsell. After purchasing an item, customers would be presented with a custom up-sell, where they could add something to their order with one click. Having upsells are key to increasing profits and average order value, so an app like that is extremely valuable. For brands that use Shopify and have a catalog of products with an established customer base, this app can make you a lot of money. But when running something like a free plus shipping campaign, or just cold traffic to a product you are drop shipping, it is not nearly as effective as using a real funnel. Most people have losing campaigns because they are running cold traffic to a Shopify product page, and expecting customers to just purchase. Using ClickFunnels allows you to create a custom landing page for your product, collect their email, add upsells, etc.

The ability to create a much higher converting site/funnel, extremely easily with full analytics and customization without any additional plugins or add-ons that will make you more money is easily worth the $97 a month price tag. Hopefully this puts into perspective the value you get with a basic ClickFunnels account.

For beginners who are looking to start an online business, investing $97 a month from the start might not be something they want to do, which is very understandable. Depending on your business, there are ways to build a website and funnel for cheaper, but it is more time consuming is just not as versatile

ClickFunnels does offer a 14-day free trial that you can cancel any time, so trying it out is a good option. You can easily build a funnel in a day (in minutes if you use a share funnel) and test it out for yourself. Keep in mind, in this 14-day trial, you can accept payments and everything. That is something many trials don't offer, and you can really see if the price tag is worth it to you. If you use that time wisely and already have a plan, it might even pay for itself.

## ClickFunnels Top Features

### Share Funnels

One of the coolest features is "Share Funnels". This feature allows you to click a link, and instantly add a pre-built funnel to your account. No matter what kind of business you run, there is someone out there who has already tested funnels and found one that converts customers well, and you can use that to your advantage.

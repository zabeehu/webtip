"Free plus shipping" is a really powerful method to bring in more customers. It's very popular among Shopify store owners who drop ship from AliExpress. The problem is, pretty much everyone does it the wrong way. Because of this, most people think it is now dead. If you are using that same method that a lot of some gurus teach, then it is definitely dead. If you do "free plus shipping" the correct way, it is an amazing tool. The key is to build and use a proper funnel. If you can break even selling that free plus shipping product alone, you are in good shape. The real money is made with the rest of your funnel.

## The Problem With Shopify Free Plus Shipping

Most people think free plus shipping is as simple as importing a cheap AliExpress product on your Shopify store, and running ads straight to the product page. If you do this, it will completely set you up for failure. Think about it. Lets say you find a $3 product you want to use for free plus shipping. You set import this product into your store using Oberlo, and start running facebook ads to that product. If your profit margin is $6, that means you can only pay up to $6 on advertising per customer to break even. If you aren't aware, a $6 cost per purchase is actually really good, and in most cases it is more. Keep in mind this is after you find a winning audience/ad. If you are completely relying on that free plus shipping product to make you money, you will fail.

To execute free plus shipping correctly, think of your free product as a way to introduce potential customers to your higher priced products. The term "free" will attract a lot more attention. What you need to do is build an actual funnel, which can turn your free product buyers from $10 customers to $20 or $30 customers. This can be achieved with up-sells either using the same product, or higher priced complimentary products.

## What a Proper Free Plus Shipping Funnel Looks Like

To get a customer from a facebook ad, lets say it costs you $12. Your funnel brings them in to a free product which is a dog necklace, plus $8.95 shipping and handling. After they purchase this, you have a one click up-sell in place that sells them a $24 dog bracelet. Then you have another one click up-sell selling a matching leash for your dog that costs $32. You then take them to a thank you page, where will present them with what they ordered, and you can even link them to your Shopify store.

If you up-sell complimentary products that your customers want, they will buy them. It's an extremely simple strategy that most people do not understand. If you implement this into your business, you can pay more per customer, and make more money than your competition.

## How To Implement This Funnel In Your Business

That was just an example, but it is not uncommon to have free plus shipping average cart values over $25. You may be thinking, how can I do this with a Shopify store? The issue is you can't do it that easily or cheaply with Shopify. There is a great app on the Shopify app store called Zipify One Click Up-sell, where you can add up-sells to your product page. But after having your Shopify store, and adding all the necessary apps, it can get really expensive. It also is not the best way to do this.

You might be thinking it is really hard to build this funnel, which will waste even more time. There is good news though. We use this exact funnel on our e-commerce stores, and have already spent weeks to months perfecting this funnel. It is built using ClickFunnels, which is the best funnel building software available. When we first started, we didn't even use our Shopify store. All we had was the funnel, and drop shipped our free plus shipping funnel products. ClickFunnels is also cheaper than a Shopify store with all the necessary plugins.

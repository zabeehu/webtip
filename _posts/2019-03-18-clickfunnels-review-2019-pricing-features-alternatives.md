## What is ClickFunnels?

[ClickFunnels](https://www.clickfunnels.com/) is a software that allows you to easily create sales funnels. It does a lot more than that, but simply put it is the simplest funnel builder out there. It was created in 2014 by Russell Brunson, and has become a $100 Million a year business. His vision was to let people make funnels without investing thousands in coding, designing, etc. It has become the go-to tool for entrepreneurs and lets any beginner get a head start by setting up high-converting sales funnels in minutes.

## ClickFunnels Pricing

The base version of [ClickFunnels ](https://www.clickfunnels.com/)is $97 a month. There is also a $297 tier which includes more advanced features without restrictions. Both offer split testing and email integration, as well as a free 14-day free trial.

With the base version ($97/month), you are limited to 20 funnels, 100 landing pages, and 20,000 visitors a month. For most beginners and business owners who aren't scaling with very high traffic, the base tier is enough.

When you're ready to start scaling, creating more funnels, and want to use the Etison Suite, then you should upgrade to the $297 a month version. At this point, the features you gain will outweigh the price, and it should be paying for itself easily.

## The Problem with ClickFunnels

Lets start off with the problems that ClickFunnels has. There must be a reason that everyone doesn't have it right?

There are some issues, but none of them are close to a deal-breaker.

First of all, at this point in time, there is no undo button. This will most likely change in the near future but right now you can't undo. When it comes to typing and simpler things like dragging content around, undo would be nice but isn't a huge deal. When it would be a real problem is when something is deleted. Some content can be customized heavily, and if its deleted you'll have to do it all over again. We expect this to change very soon, but right now that's actually one of the biggest problems, which actually says a lot.

There are some bugs here and there, like needing to refresh every now and then, and stats not loading the first time, but again there is nothing really that a refresh or re-login can't fix. If you do have some weird issue, customer support is really quick and will help you.

As for why everyone doesn't use ClickFunnels, its either that they are in too deep with other software and don't feel like switching, are stubborn, or just don't understand the power of sales funnels in general. Almost every successful entrepreneur is aware of the power of ClickFunnels, and unless they have their own team to code custom funnels and high designers, they probably use and promote ClickFunnels.

### Is ClickFunnels worth it?

Almost $100 per month price might seem high for some beginners, but is it really? The amount of tools that ClickFunnels replaces is insane, and not to mention plugins or apps to expand functionality. With the base plan, that is all you need to run your business. So for beginners, using just ClickFunnels is very good value and can allow you to have all the features you might not have even had before for less money. You can have a website, blog, e-commerce storefront, up-sells, automatic emails, opt-in pages, and webinars. I'm probably forgetting something else, but digging deeper in to the features, ClickFunnels is actually the only software beginners need. And if you still aren't sure, the 14-day free trial should be enough to convince you.

### Is ClickFunnels a scam?

The way some people try to advertise ClickFunnels can be kind of scammy. The reason for this, no one really knows. Most of them are probably just trying to make money off of you without giving real value. The fact is that ClickFunnels is in no way a scam, and that every business needs funnels. Whether you like ClickFunnels as a software is up to you, but the thousands of entrepreneurs who have tried it can vouch that it is the easiest way to build funnels, and that the community and support is huge. There's nothing better than having people around you that are successful, and are willing to help you.

## ClickFunnels Top Features List

### Drag and Drop Page Builder

ClickFunnels is all about ease of use. Building a funnel with Clickfunnels does not require any coding, development, or designing experience. Everything is drag and drop, and has a very small learning curve. This means an entrepreneur can stop wasting time and even if they don't have much experience, they can create an offer and sales funnel that converts very well, without all the time and effort required in the past. As mentioned before, funnels can be copied and shared, so all you need to do is add your copy, images, and customize colors and stuff to your own liking.

### Share Funnels

Not only can you choose from funnels that are provided by ClickFunnels, but people all over the internet have created funnels for all different kinds of businesses and offers. They are called Share Funnels. This means no matter what you want to do, there is a pre-built funnel for it. Just import and customize. It is always important to test different funnels and designs, but this feature overall can save you a lot of time.

### Simple A/B testing

With each funnel, you can create a simple A/B test, which allows you to test 2 versions of a funnel automatically. There is a slider where you can decide how the traffic gets split between the 2 and you will see the conversion results. To test properly, it is important to make subtle changes and make sure you're aware of the differences so you can clearly track and improve your funnels. You never know what can improve you conversions, so this easy testing is a killer feature, even if it is really simple.

## How to get started with ClickFunnels

If you've decided that you want to use sales funnels, you are ahead of the game. But you might be thinking, how will you actually make a funnel? How long will it take? How do I know it will work? These are all valid questions that you should be asking. There's a reason ClickFunnels has become so popular, and it is that you have the choice to build your own funnel, or use pre-built funnels. ClickFunnels has many funnels offered off the bat including e-commerce funnels, email opt-ins, webinar funnels, and many more. The great thing is that the structure of these funnels are proven, and all you have to do is customize them for your business and add copy. The best part, users can build funnels, and instantly share them with anyone else in the world. This means all over the internet are people sharing their funnels for free so you can copy them and try to imitate their success. The key is to find funnels that are proven and have high conversion rates. This means less work for you, and can help you reach your goals faster. As long as you have a vision and a product to offer, you should have no issue launching your first funnel.

## Who is ClickFunnels for?

For anybody pursuing online business and marketing, there is a place for ClickFunnels as a software. It can actually be the only software you use, which can be really efficient and cost effective.

### ClickFunnels for E-Commerce

When it comes to e-commerce, a lot of gurus online try to make it seem like you can start selling something and make lot of money by running ads on Facebook, and sending traffic to a simple product page, and it will sell itself.

This is really sad and is giving people the wrong impression, which is causing them to lose money. Just having a product showcase which something like Shopify can definitely work, but usually for brands that already have authority, customers, and proven products that people are ready to buy. It can also sometimes work when a product is going viral, people have nowhere else to buy it so they just buy from that store they see an ad for. Even if that method does produce sales, the profits and conversion rate that can be achieved is nowhere near a good funnel.

ClickFunnels can allow you to get the most out of each visitor and increase profits drastically.

One of the main factors in e-commerce and paid advertising is cost per purchase. The amount it costs you to get a sale. If the pure profit is more than the product cost and cost per purchase combined, that is great.

If you have a [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) store and send people to a product page with no funnel, the amount of sales you get will be less, you won't start building an email list, and your average order value will be less.

Let's say it costs you $10 to get a sale from Facebook ads. You are selling your product for $30, and it costs you $15 to get. This means you have a $5 profit. If a customer doesn't buy, you didn't get anything from them, and you cannot talk to them again unless you pay more for ads/re-targeting.

This definitely isn't great, and it will be really easy to start losing money if something goes wrong. Let's see what your numbers can look like in your e-commerce business if you implement sales funnels with ClickFunnels.

It still costs you $10 to get a customer, but this time you are going to be smarter with the money you spend on ads. The first thing you do is have a landing page, where you actually sell the product, using reviews, photos, good copy, and provide value by having an irresistible offer by adding a digital product, a course, a warranty, or just bundling items together. All of this can be easily done with ClickFunnels. For them to get to the next step, they have to submit their email. This is key, because even if they do NOT buy, you can have automated emails, which will let you keep in touch with them, remind them about your business, offer better discounts, all for free. When they get to the next step, they will enter shipping and payment information, all in one step so they will have less chances to get distracted and not buy. Once they buy, there is still more. They will be presented with an up-sell, where they can get complimentary product that they NEED to get full advantage or a better experience. If they say no, the next page can offer the same thing, with an insane discount that they cannot decline. Next, you can offer them something else, or even more of the same thing if appropriate. In the end, what you end up with is an average order value that is a lot more than the original $30. Now it is $55. And don't forget, you can make even more money buy setting up emails for the customers who didn't buy, and it is basically free money when they do end up buying in the future.

This means after your expenses ($10 FB ads, $15 product cost), you end up with $30 in profit instead of $5. This isn't that hard to implement, as long as you understand your ideal customer, and provide real value and trust. This is where the real money is made, and ClickFunnels lets you execute all of this easily.

### ClickFunnels for Drop Shipping

This falls under e-commerce, but some people only drop ship, and using ClickFunnels can be the key to success for drop shippers in 2019.

For example, at this point most people say free plus shipping is completely dead. Its because the original way just using Shopify and no up-sells is just not profitable enough. You can gain an incredible amount of emails using this funnel, and if you can break even with ad cost and product cost, the money is made with the upsells. This is how it should have been done in the first place, and can still be used to make money. It's really popular for beginners because they see sales and can build an email list, but using a good funnel and a good product you can actually make some real money. You can even just use this funnel to bring in a lot of customers, and introduce them to you higher ticket products.

### ClickFunnels to Build an Email List

Building an email list is key for any business, and a lot of people ignore this. They say on average you should make about $1 per person on your email list per month. So if you have 1000 people on you list, that's an extra $1000 per month. After a while, this list can build up to a pretty large amount, so this is something to take advantage of.

To build a list, you need something of value that you can exchange for someones email. This can be a free course, ebook, cheat sheet, guide, or anything else of value.

In ClickFunnels, you can literally create a high-converting email opt-in funnel in minutes just by customizing one of the pre-built funnels. There are professionals who build funnels for a living, so this is a great example of how easy it can be to start using a funnel in your business.

### ClickFunnels for a Business Website

Not everyone knows this, but you can actually just make a website with ClickFunnels, and it's really easy.

Now its not really recommended if you just want a personal blog or something, but where this really makes sense is if your website if mainly a way for customers to get in the funnels you have created. Some of the biggest growing businesses websites just consists of funnels. You can easily achieve this with ClickFunnels, and its a great way to take full advantage of all your visitors, and will be the wave in the future. Keep in mind if you go this route, you can still have a homepage, blog, about us, and more all made with a drag and drop interface.

### ClickFunnels for a Membership Site

Creating a membership site where your product generates revenue on a monthly basis is a great way to make money in 2019, and a lot of people are teaching this. If you can create your own product, and find a way to keep people signed up for months or even years, this is a killer business model.

With ClickFunnels, you can easily run a membership business, by using the proven funnels, page designs, and even manage your customers all in ClickFunnels itself. It's the best way to do it, and is really simple to manage.

### ClickFunnels to Build Landing Pages

If all you want to do is build landing pages and send customers to your Shopify store or elsewhere, the templates available and the process to build a landing page is so easy. No need to know HTML, coding, design, or anything. Again, you can start with one of the templates, or if you have your own design, that can be created in ClickFunnels so easily its laughable. Landing pages are where the money is made and customers are gained, so it literally pays for itself with its ease of use.

## ClickFunnels Affiliate Program

One of the biggest bonuses for ClickFunnels is the affiliate program. If you don't know what affiliate marketing is, it's when you get paid to promote other people's products. If you refer someone else to ClickFunnels, you get paid 40% of monthly recurring revenue. It comes out to about $38 per user when they get the base version, and you get paid that amount monthly for as long as they have ClickFunnels.

If you love ClickFunnels and have an audience to recommend it to, or find a way to advertise it, you can make some serious money. This program is open to all users for free, and should definitely be taken advantage of.

#### Is ClickFunnels a pyramid scheme?

There is talk going around where people think ClickFunnels is a pyramid scheme. This goes back to what we said before about how people advertise ClickFunnels in a spammy way, and is not good for the community. The right way to use the affiliate program and the only way that really matters is if you advertise and recommend ClickFunnels to business owners that can implement funnels the best and most efficient way possible. Like we stated plenty of times, and almost all entrepreneurs agree, every business should use funnels. The only question is do you like ClickFunnels as a tool. Most people agree that it is by far the best, and affiliate marketers should advertise that way.

When people are trying to sell ClickFunnels by saying you should get ClickFunnels and tell the people that buy to sell it to others and so on, it's not right. It's not that its a pyramid scheme, but it is just stupid.  The people who are actually making money with the affiliate program are providing value, and recommending it to people who need funnels in their business. That's really it. It is NOT a pyramid scheme, it's just good product that all entrepreneurs can take advantage of. There will always be people that just want a quick buck, and will say whatever to try and get a sale.

Many businesses offer an affiliate program, and its a great way to grow as a business. ClickFunnels just has a really good compensation plan, and people are trying to make money without putting in any effort. All you end up with is pointless talk and negativity.

## Conclusion - Should you purchase ClickFunnels?

Simply put, it doesn't matter if you're a drop shipper, affiliate marketer, lead generator, or even a dentist. If you are pursuing online business and have not implemented any real sales funnels yet, ClickFunnels is by far the best option. It is even possible to save money by switching to ClickFunnels, because you can eliminate other services that it replaces.

If you already have some funnels in place but are looking to switch, it is definitely an easy transition that is worth it. The simplicity, the community and support, and ability to copy/share funnels is all great. Not to mention you can easily build and manage a huge email list all in ClickFunnels.

Overall, the only downside to ClickFunnels is that it can be buggy sometimes, and maybe the price for some people that may not take advantage of all the features, but for 99% of people, ClickFunnels is by far the best tool for entrepreneurs and will make you a lot of money.

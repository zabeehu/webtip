## ClickFunnels Pricing - Is it worth it?

The regular version of ClickFunnels is $97 a month. There is also a $197 tier which includes more advanced features when it comes to email automation, but the $97 tier is sufficient for most.

This price might seem steep to some beginners, but when it comes down to it, ClickFunnels offers features that no one else offers at this price. You can build an entire site, without needing to buy any plugins or add-ons. Comparing it to something like a Shopify or WordPress site, all the plugins needed to reach the features of a Clickfunnels page would easily cost more, while being harder to use.

The ability to create a much higher converting site/funnel, extremely easily with full analytics and customization without any additional plugins or add-ons that will make you more money is easily worth the $97 a month price tag. Hopefully this puts into perspective the value you get with a basic ClickFunnels account.

For beginners who are looking to start an online business, investing $97 a month from the start might not be something they want to do, which is very understandable. Depending on your business, there are ways to build a website and funnel for cheaper, but it is more time consuming is just not as versatile

ClickFunnels does offer a 14-day free trial that you can cancel any time, so trying it out is a good option. You can easily build a funnel in a day (in minutes if you use a share funnel) and test it out for yourself. Keep in mind, in this 14-day trial, you can accept payments and everything. That is something many trials don't offer, and you can really see if the price tag is worth it to you. If you use that time wisely and already have a plan, it might even pay for itself.

## ClickFunnels Top Features

### Share Funnels

One of the coolest features is "Share Funnels". This feature allows you to click a link, and instantly add a pre-built funnel to your account. No matter what kind of business you run, there is someone out there who has already tested funnels and found one that converts customers well, and you can use that to your advantage.

Making a website can be cheaper and easier than you think. For most people, the only expenses would be around 10$ for a domain (yourname.com/yourname.net/etc), web hosting, and some time. The most popular platform used is WordPress, which by itself is free. It is possible to host your website for free if you are a little more technical and are comfortable with HTML and CSS to make your site.

Affiliate marketing is a really intriguing business model that people discover when getting into online business. Get people to click your links and make a commission? It seems easy, and it can be somewhat easy if done correctly. The biggest affiliate program, and the one people find out about the most is Amazon Associates. If you're looking about how the program works, how to get accepted, and how to actually market products, you're at the right place.

<h2>How Amazon Associates Works</h2>

Amazon Associates is an affiliate program where influencers, bloggers, web developers, and other businesses can advertise products on amazon.com and earn up to a 10% commission on all sales. Associates can create special links and the customers you send to Amazon are tracked to that link. Pretty simple right?

<h2> How do I Join Amazon Associates?</h2>

There is an application process to join the Amazon's affiliate program. Typically you will need a website, usually a blog. It is common for people to be denied if they don't have a website or if their website does not have enough quality content. Content is the key to being successful with affiliate programs. If you have a blog or website with helpful guides, articles, or reviews there's a good chance you will be accepted. And if you already have a quality site with traffic, it would be a great time to get your Amazon Associates account set up.

If you have a social media presence with enough followers, you can also be accepted into Amazon Associates. Many YouTubers use affiliate programs along with blogs to generate income.

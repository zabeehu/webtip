Free plus shipping was all the rage for a long time. Nowadays, most people think it is dead. That is partially true, if you are using the same old method that made people fail and quit ecommerce. It is still possible to use free plus shipping and be a lot more profitable than you think. That is, if you do it the right way. This article will teach you how to use an actual free plus shipping funnel, instead of just putting a free plus shipping product on your ecommerce/shopify store. 

The problem with free plus shipping using Shopify

Most people think free plus shipping is as simple as importing a cheap aliexpress product on your shopify store, and running ads straight to the product page. If you do this, it will completely set you up for failure. Think about it. Lets say you find a $3 product you want to use for free plus shipping. You set import this product into your store using oberlo, and start running facebook ads to that product. If your profit margin is $6, that means you can only pay up to $6 for advertising per customer to break even. If you aren't aware, a $6 cost per purchase is actually really good, and in most cases it is more. And this is when you find a winning adset/audience. If you are completely relying on that free plus shipping product to make you money, you are setting yourself up for failure. 

Free plus shipping is a great way to get people into your funnel and brand overall. The term "free" can bring in a lot more potential customers. You can still use free plus shipping to your advantage, if you do it correctly. What you need to do is build an actual funnel, which can bring in customers to your free plus shipping product, and make them either buy more of the same product, or upsell them to buy complimentary products. If you have a proper funnel in place, it will look something like this...

To get a customer from a facebook ad, lets say it costs you $12. Your funnel brings them in to a free plus shipping product. A dog necklace is your free product. You are charging $8.95 for shipping. After they purchase this, maybe you have a one click upsell in place that costs $24. This could be a matching dog bracelet. Next you have another one click upsell selling another matching leash for you dog that costs $32. Once you get 100 purchases, your average cart value is no longer $9.95. With this funnel, its $25. This means you are able to pay more for a customer, and be even more profitable. 

This was just an example, but it is not uncommon to have free plus shipping average cart values over $25. You may be thinking, how can I do this with a shopify store? The issue is you can't do it that easily or cheaply with shopify. There is a great app on the Shopify app store called zipify one click upsell, where you can add upsells to your product page. But after having your shopify store, and adding all the necessary apps, it can get really expensive. It also is not the best way to do this.

You also might be thinking it is really hard to build this funnel, which will waste even more time. There is good news though. We use this exact funnel on our ecommerce stores, and have already spent weeks to months perfecting this funnel. It is built using clickfunnels, which is the best funnel building software available. When we first started, we didn't even use our shopify store. All we had was the funnel, and drop shipped our free plus shipping funnel products. Clickfunnels is also cheaper than
